				<header class="post-title">Reflections on a Fireside Chat</header>
				<header class="date">July 16, 2014</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>After watching the &quot;Fireside Chat with Shereef&quot; I think I have a better idea of just how DevBootcamp operates. It was interesting to hear Shereef say that DBC remains an experiment in that the members of each cohort make the session what it is. This attitude encourages boots to take ownership of their session, thus making it much more valuable&mdash;at least in my opinion. In addition, although Shereef did not say this explicitly, I think the &quot;experiment&quot; aspect applies to the curriculum as well, which seems to be ever changing. In regards to the curriculum, I am pleased that the tasks I will be completing during the prep phase are akin to those the early cohorts worked on during phases one and two. To me, this indicates growth and development by DBC.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I meet the criteria that Shereef mentioned looking for in boots&mdash;I am a nice, empathetic, passionate, curious, and motivated person&mdash;so that was reassuring. I received some more assurance when Shereef mentioned that it is common to have the fear that the other members of one’s cohort will be far superior in terms of ability. That remains my biggest fear, and it has increased since I saw a couple of my fellow boots’ blogs&mdash;they seemed to have a much better grasp on html. Now I know, though, that if I give it my all&mdash;including extra prep work outside of the DBC curriculum&mdash;I will not be unlike the other members of my cohort.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The keys for my success at DBC will be twofold. I need to remember to come to DBC each day with the &quot;kitchen mindset,&quot; ready to create and make the most of my experience. I also need to be willing to expose my ignorance regularly. Because this is all new to me, I am quite ignorant. If I try to hide this&mdash;as I surely would in a traditional classroom setting&mdash;I will cheat myself out of opportunities to learn.</p>

				<header class="post-title">My Favorite Sites</header>
				<header class="date">July 17, 2014</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p><a href="richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com">RichKidsOfInstagram.tumblr.com</a></p>
					<br> 
					<p>Although this site’s title could easily refer to the founders of Instragram after the photo&ndash;sharing service’s billion&ndash;dollar sale to Facebook, it instead refers to the heirs and heiresses who share photos of their opulent lifestyles via diamond&ndash;encrusted iPhones. Richkidsofinstagram offers up the photos that such billion&ndash;dollar babies share on Instagram, allowing regular people a glimpse of the good life. From a visual standpoint, the site is pretty poor. The relevant photos are each displayed in a golden frame that is, in turn, framed by advertisements (perhaps a nod to the materialism on which the photos focus?).</p>
					<p>But I visit for the photos, not the site’s aesthetics. I will admit that I visit in part out of envy&mdash;of course I would love to be able to participate in #WatchWednesday, use hashtags like #flyprivate, and accent my photos with the burnt orange of Hermés bags, but, alas, I cannot. However, the main reason I visit is to shake my head at the trust&ndash;funders’ exploits and be glad that I have so far been able to live a fulfilling and happy life without excessive alcohol, drugs, shopping, and desire to inspire jealousy.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href="letsrun.com">LetsRun.com</a><p>
					<br>
					<p>I visited Let’sRun for the first time in 2010 while searching for results of the Bolder Boulder 10k. Little did I know, it would turn out to be one of my favorite websites. Let’sRun began as a distraction for identical twin brothers Robert and Weldon Johnson (known as Rojo and Wejo to Letsrunners) while the two logged 150&ndash;mile weeks in Flagstaff, Arizona as part of Weldon Johnson’s quest to be a great runner. Though Wejo achieved only modest success, Let’sRun was a hit in the running community.</p>
					<p>Let’sRun functions mainly to serve fans of cross country and track and field, and it does so by gathering articles related to running. There are few publications devoted to running, and so often the best articles are one&ndash;offs in established magazines and newspapers. Let’sRun finds and links to these articles, thus offering a one&ndash;stop shopping experience for visitors. Wejo and Rojo also write previews and recaps of major events (marathons, major track meets), which, while rife with typos, are invaluable.The site itself has progressed visually over the years, although it remains cluttered. Let’sRun relies on advertising for revenue and while that ensures that the price is right for visitors, the advertising has grown increasingly annoying over the years. However, because Let’sRun has essentially cornered the market on running news, I&mdash;and many other Letsrunners&mdash;will keep coming back.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href="reddit.com">Reddit.com</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>It is difficult to answer the question &quot;What is Reddit?&quot;&mdash;perhaps its creators summed it up best with the tagline &quot;The Front Page of the Internet.&quot; It is essentially an aggregation of links submitted by the users (Redditors) that comprise its community. The links on the front page run the gamut from news to videos to jokes to the recently added &quot;Showerthoughts.&quot; It is this eclectic nature that draws me to Reddit, and the fact that it constantly changes keeps me coming back multiple times each day.</p>
					<p>The content is what drives Reddit&mdash;it certainly is nothing pretty to look at. The pages are rather Spartan in nature, lacking any nifty graphics, and Reddit has little to offer outside of the content, which can be educational, hilarious, creepy, and so much more. Good luck finding anything from the past, though, as the much&ndash;maligned search feature is more than deserving of its poor reputation.</p>
					<p>Despite its ability to draw viewers in and hold them hostage until the piercing pain of their cat’s claws in their calf shatters their focus&mdash;a desperate plea from a feline that lived without food for days as its owner sat in a trance—Reddit does not make money (at least as of last summer). This is because Reddit does not really sell anything, including advertising, because Reddit’s users are mistrusting (at best) and paranoid (at worst) when it comes to corporations. However, due to its devoted base of Redditors, Reddit will survive for the time being.</p>
