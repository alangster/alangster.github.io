						<p>JavaScript</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>In 1995, a young programmer named Brendan Eich began working for Netscape. Eich would later go on to co-found Mozilla, one of the most popular web browsers. (Eichs would also eventually be named CEO of Mozilla, but that did not end so well…) However, it was his work at Netscape that would have the greatest influence. One month after starting at Netscape, over the course of ten days, Eich created the JavaScript language, an extremely versatile and popular language.</p>
					<br>
					<p>	These days, we take it for granted that web pages are interactive—they have animations and sound, we can enter data to which they will respond, and it all occurs with lightning speed. Well, we can thank JavaScript for that. It is JavaScript that makes web browsers do things and makes web pages dynamic, thus allowing users to interact with the pages and have a better overall user experience. When you visit a page on your smartphone, there is a good chance that the site is using JavaScript to detect the type of device on which you are browsing, and then adjusting itself to give you the easiest way of navigating the site.  When you enter data like your name, address, credit card number, etc., JavaScript ensures that your input is valid, and it does so with blinding speed. The list of JavaScript’s uses is endless because it is such a versatile language, and much of that versatility is due to JavaScript’s functions. JavaScript is not unique among languages in having functions, but its functions are more adaptable than those of other languages. A language like Ruby <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2010/09/why-javascript-is-awesome/">&#34;is a toolbox with some really neat little tools that do their job really nicely,&#34; but &#34;JavaScript is a leather sheath with a really sharp knife inside. That knife can cut anything, and with it you can do anything. You can kill a bear. You can catch fish. You can whittle a piece of wood into a pony.&#34;</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>	Although so far I have only provided a ringing endorsement of JavaScript, it should be said that JavaScript does have limitations. Just perusing the list of frameworks on which JavaScript may be written is exhausting, and learning and implementing those frameworks is doubly or triply so. So while JavaScript is relatively simple to learn, it is much more difficult to use it well. JavaScript cannot access databases, something on which many sites rely, and it has security issues. The same functionality that makes JavaScript useful for analytics can be put to use maliciously. Returning to the comparison of JavaScript to a knife, it must be noted that while a very sharp knife can accomplish many tasks, there are always better, more specialized tools. Other, more specialized languages can do the same things as JavaScript, It is like building a chair with a sharp knife versus building a chair with an entire workshop of woodworking tools. Sure, both chairs will be functional, but the latter will be far more comfortable and streamlined. </p>

						<p>How I Think I Think</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>Prior to the start of Phase 0, one of the tasks I was assigned was to determine my Gregorc thinking style, so I took a short test and tallied up my responses. In doing so, I learned that my thinking style most strongly fits that of the Concrete Sequential style, followed by Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, with the latter two weighing in at roughly equal values.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Concrete sequential thinkers, according to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">this site</a>, like predictability and order, and they learn best in structured environments.  Reading this did not surprise me, as I am well aware of the fact that I function best when I have a routine. Often, the most productive and fulfilling periods of my life are those during which I live like a clock, so to speak. When my time lacks structure, I find myself drifting, unable to focus or get any work done. As a result, I think DBC will be conducive to my learning, because I will be forced to wake up early every day and take the train downtown to HQ.  I anticipate having very little free time, which, frankly, is good for me. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Because I also clocked in fairly strongly with both Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, I researched both of those thinking styles a bit as well. I found that Concrete Random thinkers like to experiment, solve problems independently, and compete with others. I do see these characteristics in myself, and part of me fears that they could be detrimental to my efforts at DBC. My impression is that DBC is based on togetherness, and so I will need to ensure that I buy into it wholeheartedly. As far as Abstract Sequential thinkers go, I learned that they like to use logic and work alone. While the first will be useful with the entire DBC curriculum, the second could become an issue.</p>
					<br>
					<p>So far in Phase 0, the workload has not been overwhelming, so I have not had issues completing my work. However, as the curriculum intensifies, that may change (already in week three I am starting to sweat a tiny bit). Therefore, moving forward, I will need to implement strategies that give me more structure. Already I have started waking up earlier, hoping to simulate the morning routine I will have to adopt come September 15<sup>th</sup>. In addition, I spend time at my local library each day working on challenges because I find that the change in environment keeps me focused.</p>
					<br>
					<p>As I progress through the DBC curriculum, I hope to become better at (and more comfortable with) working in groups. I believe part of the reason for my reservations about working with groups is I lack complete trust in others. Hopefully I will develop that trust by working with equally motivated DBC cohorts. I also hope that I become more willing to take risks in my work. I am a very practical person, and I like the things I do to work, which usually results in my relying on tried and true methods. I anticipate DBC teaching me to occasionally throw caution to the wind and take calculated risks.</p>

						<p>The Things I Think I Know About CSS Positioning</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>If no positioning is specified for an element, its positioning defaults to static. With static positioning, the element will be positioned where it would be in the complete absence of any CSS. In the picture below, each div (the colored boxes) has static positioning with no margins.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1MJMJIU.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Margins can be applied, however, as seen in the image below.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qj0Nm6s.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Static positioning does not offer much, though, so designers like to use different types of positioning.</p>
					<p>With relative positioning, the element is positioned relative to where it would have been placed with static positioning. Therefore, if a relatively-positioned element is given a margin-top of 100px, it will slide down the page 100px from where it would have been positioned initially, not 100px from the top of the page. This is what we see in the picture below with the yellow box.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KVoUf5K.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Now we give the aqua box a margin-top of 100px, and observe what happens to the yellow box: It moves down another 100px because it is positioned relative to where it would have been with static positioning. With static positioning, the yellow box would have been 100px below the aqua box, regardless of how far down the aqua box was moved. Thus, with relative positioning, the 100px of space between the aqua and yellow boxes is maintained.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kt5zLQf.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Absolute positioning is a bit more complex. When an element is absolutely-positioned, it is positioned in relation to its first parent element that does not have static positioning. If there is no such parent element, the element gets positioned relative to the html tag.</p>
					<p>In the image below, the aqua box has absolute positioning, but because it has no parent element, it is positioned relative to the html tag. In the code, the red box is a child of the aqua box, so when we give the aqua box relative positioning (i.e., non-static) and the red box absolute positioning with a 10px margin-top, the red box moves down 10px from the top of the aqua box. This is what we see below.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kt5zLQf.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Finally, fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window, anchoring it in place. This means that if a user scrolls in any direction on the page, the element will stay put in the user’s view.</p>

						<p>Reflections on a Fireside Chat</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>After watching the &quot;Fireside Chat with Shereef&quot; I think I have a better idea of just how DevBootcamp operates. It was interesting to hear Shereef say that DBC remains an experiment in that the members of each cohort make the session what it is. This attitude encourages boots to take ownership of their session, thus making it much more valuable&mdash;at least in my opinion. In addition, although Shereef did not say this explicitly, I think the &quot;experiment&quot; aspect applies to the curriculum as well, which seems to be ever changing. In regards to the curriculum, I am pleased that the tasks I will be completing during the prep phase are akin to those the early cohorts worked on during phases one and two. To me, this indicates growth and development by DBC.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I meet the criteria that Shereef mentioned looking for in boots&mdash;I am a nice, empathetic, passionate, curious, and motivated person&mdash;so that was reassuring. I received some more assurance when Shereef mentioned that it is common to have the fear that the other members of one’s cohort will be far superior in terms of ability. That remains my biggest fear, and it has increased since I saw a couple of my fellow boots’ blogs&mdash;they seemed to have a much better grasp on html. Now I know, though, that if I give it my all&mdash;including extra prep work outside of the DBC curriculum&mdash;I will not be unlike the other members of my cohort.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The keys for my success at DBC will be twofold. I need to remember to come to DBC each day with the &quot;kitchen mindset,&quot; ready to create and make the most of my experience. I also need to be willing to expose my ignorance regularly. Because this is all new to me, I am quite ignorant. If I try to hide this&mdash;as I surely would in a traditional classroom setting&mdash;I will cheat myself out of opportunities to learn.</p>

						<p>My Favorite Sites</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p><a href="http://richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com/">RichKidsOfInstagram.tumblr.com</a></p>
					<br> 
					<p>Although this site’s title could easily refer to the founders of Instragram after the photo&ndash;sharing service’s billion&ndash;dollar sale to Facebook, it instead refers to the heirs and heiresses who share photos of their opulent lifestyles via diamond&ndash;encrusted iPhones. Richkidsofinstagram offers up the photos that such billion&ndash;dollar babies share on Instagram, allowing regular people a glimpse of the good life. From a visual standpoint, the site is pretty poor. The relevant photos are each displayed in a golden frame that is, in turn, framed by advertisements (perhaps a nod to the materialism on which the photos focus?).</p>
					<p>But I visit for the photos, not the site’s aesthetics. I will admit that I visit in part out of envy&mdash;of course I would love to be able to participate in #WatchWednesday, use hashtags like #flyprivate, and accent my photos with the burnt orange of Hermés bags, but, alas, I cannot. However, the main reason I visit is to shake my head at the trust&ndash;funders’ exploits and be glad that I have so far been able to live a fulfilling and happy life without excessive alcohol, drugs, shopping, and desire to inspire jealousy.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href="http://www.letsrun.com/">LetsRun.com</a><p>
					<br>
					<p>I visited Let’sRun for the first time in 2010 while searching for results of the Bolder Boulder 10k. Little did I know, it would turn out to be one of my favorite websites. Let’sRun began as a distraction for identical twin brothers Robert and Weldon Johnson (known as Rojo and Wejo to Letsrunners) while the two logged 150&ndash;mile weeks in Flagstaff, Arizona as part of Weldon Johnson’s quest to be a great runner. Though Wejo achieved only modest success, Let’sRun was a hit in the running community.</p>
					<p>Let’sRun functions mainly to serve fans of cross country and track and field, and it does so by gathering articles related to running. There are few publications devoted to running, and so often the best articles are one&ndash;offs in established magazines and newspapers. Let’sRun finds and links to these articles, thus offering a one&ndash;stop shopping experience for visitors. Wejo and Rojo also write previews and recaps of major events (marathons, major track meets), which, while rife with typos, are invaluable.The site itself has progressed visually over the years, although it remains cluttered. Let’sRun relies on advertising for revenue and while that ensures that the price is right for visitors, the advertising has grown increasingly annoying over the years. However, because Let’sRun has essentially cornered the market on running news, I&mdash;and many other Letsrunners&mdash;will keep coming back.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>It is difficult to answer the question &quot;What is Reddit?&quot;&mdash;perhaps its creators summed it up best with the tagline &quot;The Front Page of the Internet.&quot; It is essentially an aggregation of links submitted by the users (Redditors) that comprise its community. The links on the front page run the gamut from news to videos to jokes to the recently added &quot;Showerthoughts.&quot; It is this eclectic nature that draws me to Reddit, and the fact that it constantly changes keeps me coming back multiple times each day.</p>
					<p>The content is what drives Reddit&mdash;it certainly is nothing pretty to look at. The pages are rather Spartan in nature, lacking any nifty graphics, and Reddit has little to offer outside of the content, which can be educational, hilarious, creepy, and so much more. Good luck finding anything from the past, though, as the much&ndash;maligned search feature is more than deserving of its poor reputation.</p>
					<p>Despite its ability to draw viewers in and hold them hostage until the piercing pain of their cat’s claws in their calf shatters their focus&mdash;a desperate plea from a feline that lived without food for days as its owner sat in a trance—Reddit does not make money (at least as of last summer). This is because Reddit does not really sell anything, including advertising, because Reddit’s users are mistrusting (at best) and paranoid (at worst) when it comes to corporations. However, due to its devoted base of Redditors, Reddit will survive for the time being.</p>
