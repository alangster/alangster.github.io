						<p>SQL vs NoSQL</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>The exposure to new concepts continued this week in my DBC prep as I learned all about databases. Prior to this week, I understood the basic concept of databases (i.e., that they store data), but I had no idea as to the different types of databases and how they work. </p><br>
					<p>The curriculum this week focused on SQL databases, also known as Relational databases. (SQL stands for “Standard Query Language,” which refers to the syntax of calls to retrieve data from the database.) SQL databases rely on two-dimensional tables, and so they can be thought of (in a very simple way) as a series of spreadsheets. Each table contains columns and rows, and relationships exist between tables that tie them all together. Because SQL databases are quite old, there is more support available for those using them. Additionally, they have a customary querying language, and highly standardized structure. While their standard structure simplifies their use, it also makes them more difficult to use with unstructured data.</p><br>
					<p>The alternative to an SQL database is a NoSQL database (No Standard Query Language). NoSQL databases differ from their SQL counterparts in that they do not store data in tables and instead rely on a number of different models for that purpose. NoSQL databases are extremely diverse, but they can be divided into four broad data model types: column, document, key-value, and graph.</p><br>
					<p>The column data model is most similar to SQL databases in that it consists of columns (each of which have a name, value, and timestamp), groups of which can superficially resemble a table. However, although a group of columns may appear to have “rows,” it still is not a strict table, as each “row” will not necessarily have an instance of each column. The document data model is just as it sounds: It is a collection of complete documents full of information. Each document is akin to a row in a table, except a documents contains far more information than a row. The key-value data model is like a Ruby hash, with many unique keys, each paired with a value.The graph data model is the most visually stimulating, as it stores data using map-like graphs.</p><br>
					<p>It should be clear from the above explanation of data models, that NoSQL databases are nowhere as structured as SQL databases. As a result, NoSQL databases work handle unstructured data better than SQL databases do, and this has made them increasingly popular in the era of big data. They are considered to be more efficient and scalable than SQL databases because they lack the stringent organization found in SQL databases. However, as their name suggests, NoSQL databases lack a standard query language, and this fact, combined with their many different structure options, makes them more difficult to implement and means there is less support available for those using them.</p><br>
					<p>Personally, I prefer the safety of SQL databases, but I am intrigued by NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases seem more customizable, and so I see their appeal and wonder if the frequency with which they are used will increase as new ways are developed to collect more and different types of data.</p>

						<p>Stereotype Threat</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>Although previously unfamiliar with stereotype threat, I was indeed familiar with its effects. Reading about stereotype threat reminded me of studies in which stereotypes were explicitly stated prior to tests being administered. In those cases, the stereotypes were confirmed, but stereotype threat is an entirely different animal. It seems that even if no stereotypes are broached, one’s own fear of confirming stereotypes can have a negative impact on performance.</p><br>
					<p>As a white male, I am subjected to far fewer negative stereotypes than are women and minorities, but it still happens. The first example that came to mind was a scenario that played out repeatedly over the course of my high school track and field career. At every meet, I ran a leg of the 4x400m relay for my team. Like me, the three other members of the squad were white, and we almost always faced squads with at least two black runners. Of course, we noticed our lily-whiteness, and got it into our heads that we were nowhere near as fast as the people we were racing. Thoroughly psyched out, we rarely performed to our potential.</p><br>
					<p>A more recent example is something I am currently experiencing. I just graduated from university this past spring, and the last few months have been spent in a post-grad daze. While DBC has forced me to be more on top of things and prompted me to begin awaking early in the day, I still feel as though I am drifting, which makes me feel guilty. I think this is due in part to stereotype threat, but the stereotype has nothing to do with race or gender—it has to do with age. I am part of the millennial generation, and millenials are stereotyped as lazy and entitled. I currently dread encounters with older adults because I am always asked, “So do you have a job?” When I answer with an explanation of what I am up to, I try so hard not to make it sound like I am simply lounging at my parents’ home in front of my computer that I sound fake and disingenuous.</p><br>
					<p>Now that I am aware of stereotype threat, I think I have a better idea of how to alleviate it in social and professional situations. Moving forward, I will take care not to broach issues of race, gender, or age, and instead focus on getting people to recognize their talents. As for my own feelings of stereotype threat, I do not have a plan to deal with them. Basically, I will try to look out for number one and disregard what others may be thinking.</p><br>

						<p>Declare Variables, Not War</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>While every Ruby object has its purpose, variables are one of the more useful sorts, and they are rather basic in terms of their implementation. There are four main sorts of Ruby variables, and each has its own scope, or visibility, that determines how and by what the variable can be accessed. We’ll explore variables and, their scopes, in this entry.</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rid5tiy.png"><br>
					<p>At the top of our list, and with the broadest scope, are global variables. These variables are recognizable by their names, which begin with the $ symbol. Fittingly, global variables have what is referred to as “global scope,” meaning they are recognizable everywhere. Global variables can push right through the boundaries imposed by classes, modules, and methods, and can be accessed inside any of those. If you wish to have a variable that is used by all methods and within all classes in your program, then a global variable is a viable option. Given this fact, one would imagine that global variables are used frequently, but that is not the case. In fact, global variables are used quite infrequently in Ruby because they are not very flexible. They are given a value, and then they stay that value until changed. Part of the beauty of Ruby lies in having many different objects that work together, and global variables eliminate that together-ness.</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/V4yXnB5.png"><br>
					<p>Instance variables are another type of variable with a unique syntax (as seen above), although their scope is far more limited than that of global variables. Instance variables belong to an instance of a class, and so they are accessible by objects that are instances of that class. For each instance of the class, an instance variable may take on a different value.  A common use for instance variables is in the initialize methods of classes, an example of which can be seen above. When a new object is created in the class C, that specific object is created with the instance variable set to a certain, unique value. A different object in class C can have a completely different value for the instance variable. As for their scope, only instance methods can call the instance variables.</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IfP3lXY.png"><br>
					<p>Between global and instance variables in terms of scope are class variables. Their syntax is only slightly different from instance variables (as seen above) but they have very different uses. Class variables are shared among instances of a class, so they have a single value. In the example above, every object that is created as an instance of class C will share the class variable and its value.</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/efwaWBx.png"></img><br>
					<p>Finally, there are local variables. These variables are the most limited in scope, and they lack any fancy syntax. Any Ruby program will have multiple local scopes through which it moves as the program runs. For example, every class, module, and method has its own local scope, as does the top level (i.e., beyond all definition blocks). Because they are exclusive to their local scope, one could re-use the same name for local variables across multiple local scopes and assign each variable a unique value. While this would go against best practice, it would still work, because each local variable would only be accessible within its local scope. Now, armed with this knowledge, go make some variables!</p>

						<p>The Pleasures of Pairing</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>Although the DBC prep phase is completed remotely, that does not mean that we budding developers do not meet. In fact, we have quite a bit of interaction, and it occurs through pairing sessions. Thanks to developers who came before us, we are able to videochat and screenshare while we work on challenges together. So far, all of my pairing sessions have gone well and I have not encountered any dismissive or combative pairs. In my opinion, one reason the sessions have gone so well is that I have yet to pair with someone whose knowledge of Ruby, Javascript, or HTML far exceeds mine. Thus, we have worked together to solve the challenges—there has not been any monopolizing of the session by a superior coder.</p><br>
					<p>In one of my recent sessions I experienced genuine excitement. My pair and I had a great rapport and were bouncing ideas off one another when we suddenly realized how we could drastically simplify our solution. What had been a long, somewhat draining session was suddenly given a jolt of excitement, and we happily worked through the rest of the challenge with renewed vigor. In my individual work, I have experienced such “brain blast” moments before, but sharing it with a peer made it so much sweeter.</p><br>
					<p>After pairing, we have to provide anonymous feedback to our pair. Often, after completing a pairing session, I am relieved that the challenge is finished and simply want to move on to the next one. Therefore, I have to stop myself from writing generic feedback, such as “Good job.” Instead, because it will be far more valuable to my pair, I must provide feedback that is specific and actionable (as well as kind, because I do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings). Specific feedback references individual things that the pair did well (or not well) to encourage (or discourage) that behavior in the future. Actionable feedback provides the pair with suggestions of alternative approaches to try in the future.</p><br>
					<p>Reading the feedback I receive is an interesting experience. I am used to receiving generic feedback from my classmates in school, and so I am predisposed to simply brush feedback off. But my DBC cohorts are changing me for the better. Their specific and actionable feedback has made me realize aspects of my approach to solving challenges that I should reexamine, especially as DBC phase one nears and I will be working in pairs most of the time. One suggestion I have received a couple times is to be more willing to use Google to find solutions. I tend to shy away from this because I like figuring things out on my own, but if a method exists that exists specifically to accomplish what I am trying to do, it would be silly not to at least try to find and use it.</p><br>

						<p>A Quick Class on Ruby Classes</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>This week’s DBC prep has been focused on Ruby classes. A simple way to think of classes in Ruby is that a class is a group to which objects can be added. All of the objects of a class share certain attributes as well as methods that may be called on them. The values of the aforementioned attributes, however, may vary among the objects. I learn best when I have examples, so let’s do one!</p><br>
					<p>Imagine we want to model a baseball team. We would start by creating a Team class, like so:</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/bSTxP2u.png"><br>
					<p>Now, each team object that we create will be an instance of our Team class, provided we create it as follows:</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LRzYJP8.png"><br>
					<p>Right now, our “cubs” object is rather meaningless, as we have not given the objects in our Team class any methods. Let’s change that! We will start by defining an initialize method for the Team class. This method runs every time a new object in the Team class is created, and you can think of it as setting certain attributes of each object. For now, let’s give each Team object a name, city, manager, and star player. We’ll do that like this:</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wPx3mvH.png"><br>
					<p>Now, if we look back at creating our “cubs” object, we will enter the data as shown below.</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rVUu7ua.png"><br>
					<p>Still, though, nothing is really happening, because we have not coded the initialize method to actually do anything other than accept some strings. To change that, we will use instance variables. Instance variables are variables that can only be “seen” by the objects to which they belong, and they are used to set an object’s state (i.e. its properties, which in this case are its name, city, manager, and star player). Instance variables begin with the @ symbol, as shown below.</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1xaiuYa.png"><br>
					<p>Now when we create our “cubs” object, its state will be set with the values, “Cubs,” “Chicago,” “Rick Renteria,” and “Anthony Rizzo.” Admittedly, we still cannot do much, so let’s create some methods that can be called on all Team objects. These methods will be .name, .city, .manager, and .star_player, and each will return the value of that attribute. Here is how we do it:</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/82xhDFn.png"><br>
					<p>If we call cubs.star_player, the method will return “Anthony Rizzo.” You can probably figure out what the other methods would return. You could use this feature like so:</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2HYyfsF.png"><br>
					<p>Hopefully you have a general idea of how and why to use classes, so I will wrap this up with one last method that does a bit more than our others. Unfortunately, teams sometimes trade away their star players. When this happens, another player generally becomes the new star. Therefore, we will define a method that allows us to adjust a team’s star player. (To add a method to a previously established class, just open the class up as if you were creating it again.)</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fishZEL.png"><br>
					<p>If, in the Cubs’ case, Anthony Rizzo were traded today, the new star player would be Javier Baez, and to set this, we would call the following:</p><br>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Kgyw4wr.png"><br>
					<p>There is much more to classes than I have presented here, but I hope this was an informative little session.</p><br>

						<p>Net Neutrality</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>In an era of unprecedented connectivity and consistent advances in technology, the tech world is under attack from politicians and corporations. The attack is on net neutrality, and it is coming the form of legislation. Net neutrality “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally</a>.” With net neutrality, no users, content, or applications are discriminated against, and the internet remains an even playing field. Although net neutrality has freedom of speech implications if the government attempts to censor content, perhaps the more damaging attack is coming from ISPs.</p><br>
					<p>In the early days of the internet, there were not many users, and so ISPs did not have to provide much bandwith. As more and more people became internet-savvy, ISPs faced increased demand for bandwith. The explosion of video-streaming sites in the last decade or so has only exacerbated the increase, and led ISPs to begin offering customers more bandwith—for a price. Even when customers pay for more bandwith, they do not always receive it. ISPs have frequently been accused of throttling—intentionally slowing down—their customers’ internet speeds when using certain sites, such as Netflix. Such actions obviously discourage customers from using those sites and cheat the customers, who are paying for bandwith they are not receiving.</p><br>
					<p>Some ISPs have argued that they should be allowed to charge sites to deliver their content. While there is clearly something wrong with charging a site just to have the speed it should, it is doubly wrong to offer sites the opportunity to get a leg up on their competition by paying for their content to be delivered faster than normal. If such a pay-to-play system comes into being, it will be difficult for small innovative sites to establish themselves amongst deep-pocketed competitors.</p><br>
					<p>Net neutrality emphasizes equality on the internet, and any actions that threaten that equality need to be rebuffed through public outcry. Hopefully, advancements such as the expansion of Google Fiber (which offers cheap, extremely fast internet) will force the ISPs’ hands and cement net neutrality.</p><br>

						<p>Enumerables</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>If you are like me (and I pity you if that is the case), you probably do not quite know what enumerable means. So, here it is: Enumerable means countable. It’s really that simple. So, in Ruby, when we say “enumerable,” we are talking about methods that operate on objects that are countable. Such objects are arrays and hashes, and when we use an enumerable, we iterate over each element of the array or hash, and do something with or to each element. Of course, this can be achieved with a “for” loop, but using enumerables is more efficient, more direct, and just plain sexy.</p><br>
					<p>One of the coolest enumerable methods is the .map method. The .map method iterates over each element of the array and performs whatever task you give it on each element. The output is then saved to a new array. For example, if you had an array of strings of the titles of all the Harry Potter novels (call it harry_potters), and you wanted to add “by JK Rowling” to the end of each title (because you worry some people led deprived childhoods), you could simply call harry_potters.map { |book| book + “by JK Rowling” }. It’s that simple. The resulting array would be separate from the original array of titles, unless of course you decided to call .map! Calling .map! permanently changes the original array.</p>

				<article class="post-text">
					<p>In 1995, a young programmer named Brendan Eich began working for Netscape. Eich would later go on to co-found Mozilla, one of the most popular web browsers. (Eichs would also eventually be named CEO of Mozilla, but that did not end so well…) However, it was his work at Netscape that would have the greatest influence. One month after starting at Netscape, over the course of ten days, Eich created the JavaScript language, an extremely versatile and popular language.</p>
					<br>
					<p>	These days, we take it for granted that web pages are interactive—they have animations and sound, we can enter data to which they will respond, and it all occurs with lightning speed. Well, we can thank JavaScript for that. It is JavaScript that makes web browsers do things and makes web pages dynamic, thus allowing users to interact with the pages and have a better overall user experience. When you visit a page on your smartphone, there is a good chance that the site is using JavaScript to detect the type of device on which you are browsing, and then adjusting itself to give you the easiest way of navigating the site.  When you enter data like your name, address, credit card number, etc., JavaScript ensures that your input is valid, and it does so with blinding speed. The list of JavaScript’s uses is endless because it is such a versatile language, and much of that versatility is due to JavaScript’s functions. JavaScript is not unique among languages in having functions, but its functions are more adaptable than those of other languages. A language like Ruby <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2010/09/why-javascript-is-awesome/">&#34;is a toolbox with some really neat little tools that do their job really nicely,&#34; but &#34;JavaScript is a leather sheath with a really sharp knife inside. That knife can cut anything, and with it you can do anything. You can kill a bear. You can catch fish. You can whittle a piece of wood into a pony.&#34;</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>	Although so far I have only provided a ringing endorsement of JavaScript, it should be said that JavaScript does have limitations. Just perusing the list of frameworks on which JavaScript may be written is exhausting, and learning and implementing those frameworks is doubly or triply so. So while JavaScript is relatively simple to learn, it is much more difficult to use it well. JavaScript cannot access databases, something on which many sites rely, and it has security issues. The same functionality that makes JavaScript useful for analytics can be put to use maliciously. Returning to the comparison of JavaScript to a knife, it must be noted that while a very sharp knife can accomplish many tasks, there are always better, more specialized tools. Other, more specialized languages can do the same things as JavaScript, It is like building a chair with a sharp knife versus building a chair with an entire workshop of woodworking tools. Sure, both chairs will be functional, but the latter will be far more comfortable and streamlined. </p>

						<p>How I Think I Think</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>Prior to the start of Phase 0, one of the tasks I was assigned was to determine my Gregorc thinking style, so I took a short test and tallied up my responses. In doing so, I learned that my thinking style most strongly fits that of the Concrete Sequential style, followed by Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, with the latter two weighing in at roughly equal values.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Concrete sequential thinkers, according to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">this site</a>, like predictability and order, and they learn best in structured environments.  Reading this did not surprise me, as I am well aware of the fact that I function best when I have a routine. Often, the most productive and fulfilling periods of my life are those during which I live like a clock, so to speak. When my time lacks structure, I find myself drifting, unable to focus or get any work done. As a result, I think DBC will be conducive to my learning, because I will be forced to wake up early every day and take the train downtown to HQ.  I anticipate having very little free time, which, frankly, is good for me. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Because I also clocked in fairly strongly with both Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, I researched both of those thinking styles a bit as well. I found that Concrete Random thinkers like to experiment, solve problems independently, and compete with others. I do see these characteristics in myself, and part of me fears that they could be detrimental to my efforts at DBC. My impression is that DBC is based on togetherness, and so I will need to ensure that I buy into it wholeheartedly. As far as Abstract Sequential thinkers go, I learned that they like to use logic and work alone. While the first will be useful with the entire DBC curriculum, the second could become an issue.</p>
					<br>
					<p>So far in Phase 0, the workload has not been overwhelming, so I have not had issues completing my work. However, as the curriculum intensifies, that may change (already in week three I am starting to sweat a tiny bit). Therefore, moving forward, I will need to implement strategies that give me more structure. Already I have started waking up earlier, hoping to simulate the morning routine I will have to adopt come September 15<sup>th</sup>. In addition, I spend time at my local library each day working on challenges because I find that the change in environment keeps me focused.</p>
					<br>
					<p>As I progress through the DBC curriculum, I hope to become better at (and more comfortable with) working in groups. I believe part of the reason for my reservations about working with groups is I lack complete trust in others. Hopefully I will develop that trust by working with equally motivated DBC cohorts. I also hope that I become more willing to take risks in my work. I am a very practical person, and I like the things I do to work, which usually results in my relying on tried and true methods. I anticipate DBC teaching me to occasionally throw caution to the wind and take calculated risks.</p>

						<p>The Things I Think I Know About CSS Positioning</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>If no positioning is specified for an element, its positioning defaults to static. With static positioning, the element will be positioned where it would be in the complete absence of any CSS. In the picture below, each div (the colored boxes) has static positioning with no margins.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1MJMJIU.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Margins can be applied, however, as seen in the image below.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qj0Nm6s.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Static positioning does not offer much, though, so designers like to use different types of positioning.</p>
					<p>With relative positioning, the element is positioned relative to where it would have been placed with static positioning. Therefore, if a relatively-positioned element is given a margin-top of 100px, it will slide down the page 100px from where it would have been positioned initially, not 100px from the top of the page. This is what we see in the picture below with the yellow box.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KVoUf5K.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Now we give the aqua box a margin-top of 100px, and observe what happens to the yellow box: It moves down another 100px because it is positioned relative to where it would have been with static positioning. With static positioning, the yellow box would have been 100px below the aqua box, regardless of how far down the aqua box was moved. Thus, with relative positioning, the 100px of space between the aqua and yellow boxes is maintained.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kt5zLQf.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Absolute positioning is a bit more complex. When an element is absolutely-positioned, it is positioned in relation to its first parent element that does not have static positioning. If there is no such parent element, the element gets positioned relative to the html tag.</p>
					<p>In the image below, the aqua box has absolute positioning, but because it has no parent element, it is positioned relative to the html tag. In the code, the red box is a child of the aqua box, so when we give the aqua box relative positioning (i.e., non-static) and the red box absolute positioning with a 10px margin-top, the red box moves down 10px from the top of the aqua box. This is what we see below.</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kt5zLQf.png" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>Finally, fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window, anchoring it in place. This means that if a user scrolls in any direction on the page, the element will stay put in the user’s view.</p>

						<p>Reflections on a Fireside Chat</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p>After watching the &quot;Fireside Chat with Shereef&quot; I think I have a better idea of just how DevBootcamp operates. It was interesting to hear Shereef say that DBC remains an experiment in that the members of each cohort make the session what it is. This attitude encourages boots to take ownership of their session, thus making it much more valuable&mdash;at least in my opinion. In addition, although Shereef did not say this explicitly, I think the &quot;experiment&quot; aspect applies to the curriculum as well, which seems to be ever changing. In regards to the curriculum, I am pleased that the tasks I will be completing during the prep phase are akin to those the early cohorts worked on during phases one and two. To me, this indicates growth and development by DBC.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I meet the criteria that Shereef mentioned looking for in boots&mdash;I am a nice, empathetic, passionate, curious, and motivated person&mdash;so that was reassuring. I received some more assurance when Shereef mentioned that it is common to have the fear that the other members of one’s cohort will be far superior in terms of ability. That remains my biggest fear, and it has increased since I saw a couple of my fellow boots’ blogs&mdash;they seemed to have a much better grasp on html. Now I know, though, that if I give it my all&mdash;including extra prep work outside of the DBC curriculum&mdash;I will not be unlike the other members of my cohort.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The keys for my success at DBC will be twofold. I need to remember to come to DBC each day with the &quot;kitchen mindset,&quot; ready to create and make the most of my experience. I also need to be willing to expose my ignorance regularly. Because this is all new to me, I am quite ignorant. If I try to hide this&mdash;as I surely would in a traditional classroom setting&mdash;I will cheat myself out of opportunities to learn.</p>

						<p>My Favorite Sites</p>
					</div>
				</header>
				<br>
				<article class="post-text">
					<p><a href="http://richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com/">RichKidsOfInstagram.tumblr.com</a></p>
					<br> 
					<p>Although this site’s title could easily refer to the founders of Instragram after the photo&ndash;sharing service’s billion&ndash;dollar sale to Facebook, it instead refers to the heirs and heiresses who share photos of their opulent lifestyles via diamond&ndash;encrusted iPhones. Richkidsofinstagram offers up the photos that such billion&ndash;dollar babies share on Instagram, allowing regular people a glimpse of the good life. From a visual standpoint, the site is pretty poor. The relevant photos are each displayed in a golden frame that is, in turn, framed by advertisements (perhaps a nod to the materialism on which the photos focus?).</p>
					<p>But I visit for the photos, not the site’s aesthetics. I will admit that I visit in part out of envy&mdash;of course I would love to be able to participate in #WatchWednesday, use hashtags like #flyprivate, and accent my photos with the burnt orange of Hermés bags, but, alas, I cannot. However, the main reason I visit is to shake my head at the trust&ndash;funders’ exploits and be glad that I have so far been able to live a fulfilling and happy life without excessive alcohol, drugs, shopping, and desire to inspire jealousy.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href="http://www.letsrun.com/">LetsRun.com</a><p>
					<br>
					<p>I visited Let’sRun for the first time in 2010 while searching for results of the Bolder Boulder 10k. Little did I know, it would turn out to be one of my favorite websites. Let’sRun began as a distraction for identical twin brothers Robert and Weldon Johnson (known as Rojo and Wejo to Letsrunners) while the two logged 150&ndash;mile weeks in Flagstaff, Arizona as part of Weldon Johnson’s quest to be a great runner. Though Wejo achieved only modest success, Let’sRun was a hit in the running community.</p>
					<p>Let’sRun functions mainly to serve fans of cross country and track and field, and it does so by gathering articles related to running. There are few publications devoted to running, and so often the best articles are one&ndash;offs in established magazines and newspapers. Let’sRun finds and links to these articles, thus offering a one&ndash;stop shopping experience for visitors. Wejo and Rojo also write previews and recaps of major events (marathons, major track meets), which, while rife with typos, are invaluable.The site itself has progressed visually over the years, although it remains cluttered. Let’sRun relies on advertising for revenue and while that ensures that the price is right for visitors, the advertising has grown increasingly annoying over the years. However, because Let’sRun has essentially cornered the market on running news, I&mdash;and many other Letsrunners&mdash;will keep coming back.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>It is difficult to answer the question &quot;What is Reddit?&quot;&mdash;perhaps its creators summed it up best with the tagline &quot;The Front Page of the Internet.&quot; It is essentially an aggregation of links submitted by the users (Redditors) that comprise its community. The links on the front page run the gamut from news to videos to jokes to the recently added &quot;Showerthoughts.&quot; It is this eclectic nature that draws me to Reddit, and the fact that it constantly changes keeps me coming back multiple times each day.</p>
					<p>The content is what drives Reddit&mdash;it certainly is nothing pretty to look at. The pages are rather Spartan in nature, lacking any nifty graphics, and Reddit has little to offer outside of the content, which can be educational, hilarious, creepy, and so much more. Good luck finding anything from the past, though, as the much&ndash;maligned search feature is more than deserving of its poor reputation.</p>
					<p>Despite its ability to draw viewers in and hold them hostage until the piercing pain of their cat’s claws in their calf shatters their focus&mdash;a desperate plea from a feline that lived without food for days as its owner sat in a trance—Reddit does not make money (at least as of last summer). This is because Reddit does not really sell anything, including advertising, because Reddit’s users are mistrusting (at best) and paranoid (at worst) when it comes to corporations. However, due to its devoted base of Redditors, Reddit will survive for the time being.</p>
