<p>Although I have already made changes to my index.html page, I plan to make some more. I like the title where it currently is, although I am going to tweak it a bit. Additionally, I plan to add a "tagline" underneath it. The links to social media will move up the page to a bar extending from the right side of the page, and the past blog posts will be fixed below that. The text of the blog posts needs better spacing and a different font. For a better idea, see the wireframe below.</p>
