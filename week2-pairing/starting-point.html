      <header>What is Responsive Design?</header>
      <p>Responsive design involves considering the site's structure and how
        objects fit into that structure. The focus is on creating a positive user
        experience, regardless of the medium through which the user views the page.<sup><a href=".references">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>With fluid layouts, dimensions are set to percentages rather than pixels.  Fluid layouts are more user friendly and have a simple design.  
      Fluid layouts are linked to media queries and special styles for optomization.<sup><a href=".references">2</a></sup></p>

      <header>Conclusion</header>
      <p>The purpose of fluid layouts is to allow good user experiences across a 
      range of viewing devices (e.g., iPhone, tablet, computer, etc.) We think that it is
      good practice to use fluid layouts, because they make sites more accessible, 
      allowing the information to reach as wide an audience as possible.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
      <ul>
        <li><p>It was difficult to integrate the responsive web design concepts into our existing design. However, once we commented out our initial design and started over with each potential screen width, it was quite simple. This indicates that perhaps one should start like that.</p></li>
        <li><p>Smartphones and tablets have certainly made design more complicated and more important. It is more complicated now because designers have to consider the different screens on which their pages may be viewed. At the same time, design has become more important because people are doing more and more (e.g., shopping) from mobile devices. In the future, I think wearable tech will change web design. Sites will need their designs to be formatted for devices like Google Glass, and such devices will also influence the way people interact with sites.</p></li> 
        <li><p>I think visually impaired people have a difficult time using the web. I know there are tools for them to do so, like text-readers and things that read alt text. We should definitely consider visually impaired people when designing, but perhaps do so by offering a different version of the page for them because focusing solely on visually imparied viewers would limit what designers can do.</p></li> 
        <li><p>The ideas that have resonated with me are aesthetic choices and responsive design. I enjoy experimenting with colors and finding interesting ways to format pages because aesthetics are important to me. The importance of responsive web design was made clear to me when I visited my index page on my iPhone and saw that it was not at all how I wanted it.</p></li>
