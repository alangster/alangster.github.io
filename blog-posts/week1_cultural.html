				<article class="post-text">
					<p>After watching the &quot;Fireside Chat with Shereef&quot; I think I have a better idea of just how DevBootcamp operates. It was interesting to hear Shereef say that DBC remains an experiment in that the members of each cohort make the session what it is. This attitude encourages boots to take ownership of their session, thus making it much more valuable&mdash;at least in my opinion. In addition, although Shereef did not say this explicitly, I think the &quot;experiment&quot; aspect applies to the curriculum as well, which seems to be ever changing. In regards to the curriculum, I am pleased that the tasks I will be completing during the prep phase are akin to those the early cohorts worked on during phases one and two. To me, this indicates growth and development by DBC.</p>
					<p>I meet the criteria that Shereef mentioned looking for in boots&mdash;I am a nice, empathetic, passionate, curious, and motivated person&mdash;so that was reassuring. I received some more assurance when Shereef mentioned that it is common to have the fear that the other members of one’s cohort will be far superior in terms of ability. That remains my biggest fear, and it has increased since I saw a couple of my fellow boots’ blogs&mdash;they seemed to have a much better grasp on html. Now I know, though, that if I give it my all&mdash;including extra prep work outside of the DBC curriculum&mdash;I will not be unlike the other members of my cohort.</p>
					<p>The keys for my success at DBC will be twofold. I need to remember to come to DBC each day with the &quot;kitchen mindset,&quot; ready to create and make the most of my experience. I also need to be willing to expose my ignorance regularly. Because this is all new to me, I am quite ignorant. If I try to hide this&mdash;as I surely would in a traditional classroom setting&mdash;I will cheat myself out of opportunities to learn.</p>
