					<p>When I think back to the points in my life at which have been the most content and happiest, the following values jump out at me: Accomplishment, Adventure, Autonomy, Confidence, Creativity, Freedom, Independence, Location, Music, Nature, Romance, Stability, and Wonder. Of those values, Location is extremely important to me. In fact, many of the values I selected stem from a particular instance in which location was most important to me. I spent February through July 2013 living and studying in Wellington, New Zealand—a city that remains dear to me. While in Wellington, I fell in love with the idea of being somewhere other than Suburbia, USA. I realized that I have to live somewhere vibrant and close to nature, somewhere where I can simply have a wander and enjoy myself immensely. In Wellington, I also became accustomed to autonomy, freedom, independence, and wonder—all of which are important to me.</p>
					<p>On a scale of 1-5, with 1 being disagree and 5 being agree, here is how I feel about the statement “I try to live up to this value.”</p>
					<p><ul>
						<li>Accomplishment — 4</li>
						<li>Adventure — 2</li>
						<li>Autonomy — 3</li>
						<li>Confidence — 4</li>
						<li>Creativity — 3</li>
						<li>Freedom — 3</li>
						<li>Independence — 4</li>
						<li>Location — 2</li>
						<li>Music — 4</li>
						<li>Nature — 2</li>
						<li>Romance — 1</li>
						<li>Stability — 5</li>
						<li>Wonder — 2</li>
					</ul></p>
					<p>As you can see, I do not think I am doing a great job of living up to my values. I have these values, and I want to live up to them, but right now, I’m not. I honestly believe that part of this is due to the current place in my life that I am in. Although I am ready and looking forward to DBC, this is still a transitional period—I am living at home and trying to figure things out. If I were asked how well I was living up to my values six months or a year ago, I would have been far more positive.</p>
					<p>As far as my values go, I think they are mostly positive. Although I did not list them above, money, appearance, and status are things that I think about. While I do not obsess over these semi-toxic values, I probably think about them more than I should. I think it would be beneficial for me to keep the values I listed earlier at the forefront of my mind, especially when I feel lost or demoralized. They may not tell me where to head, but at least they will help me plan to get somewhere.</p>
