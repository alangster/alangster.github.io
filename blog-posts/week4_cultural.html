					<p>In an era of unprecedented connectivity and consistent advances in technology, the tech world is under attack from politicians and corporations. The attack is on net neutrality, and it is coming the form of legislation. Net neutrality “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally</a>.” With net neutrality, no users, content, or applications are discriminated against, and the internet remains an even playing field. Although net neutrality has freedom of speech implications if the government attempts to censor content, perhaps the more damaging attack is coming from ISPs.</p><br>
					<p>In the early days of the internet, there were not many users, and so ISPs did not have to provide much bandwith. As more and more people became internet-savvy, ISPs faced increased demand for bandwith. The explosion of video-streaming sites in the last decade or so has only exacerbated the increase, and led ISPs to begin offering customers more bandwith—for a price. Even when customers pay for more bandwith, they do not always receive it. ISPs have frequently been accused of throttling—intentionally slowing down—their customers’ internet speeds when using certain sites, such as Netflix. Such actions obviously discourage customers from using those sites and cheat the customers, who are paying for bandwith they are not receiving.</p><br>
					<p>Some ISPs have argued that they should be allowed to charge sites to deliver their content. While there is clearly something wrong with charging a site just to have the speed it should, it is doubly wrong to offer sites the opportunity to get a leg up on their competition by paying for their content to be delivered faster than normal. If such a pay-to-play system comes into being, it will be difficult for small innovative sites to establish themselves amongst deep-pocketed competitors.</p><br>
					<p>Net neutrality emphasizes equality on the internet, and any actions that threaten that equality need to be rebuffed through public outcry. Hopefully, advancements such as the expansion of Google Fiber (which offers cheap, extremely fast internet) will force the ISPs’ hands and cement net neutrality.</p><br>
