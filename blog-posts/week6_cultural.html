						<p>Stereotype Threat</p>

					<p>Although previously unfamiliar with stereotype threat, I was indeed familiar with its effects. Reading about stereotype threat reminded me of studies in which stereotypes were explicitly stated prior to tests being administered. In those cases, the stereotypes were confirmed, but stereotype threat is an entirely different animal. It seems that even if no stereotypes are broached, one’s own fear of confirming stereotypes can have a negative impact on performance.</p><br>
					<p>As a white male, I am subjected to far fewer negative stereotypes than are women and minorities, but it still happens. The first example that came to mind was a scenario that played out repeatedly over the course of my high school track and field career. At every meet, I ran a leg of the 4x400m relay for my team. Like me, the three other members of the squad were white, and we almost always faced squads with at least two black runners. Of course, we noticed our lily-whiteness, and got it into our heads that we were nowhere near as fast as the people we were racing. Thoroughly psyched out, we rarely performed to our potential.</p><br>
					<p>A more recent example is something I am currently experiencing. I just graduated from university this past spring, and the last few months have been spent in a post-grad daze. While DBC has forced me to be more on top of things and prompted me to begin awaking early in the day, I still feel as though I am drifting, which makes me feel guilty. I think this is due in part to stereotype threat, but the stereotype has nothing to do with race or gender—it has to do with age. I am part of the millennial generation, and millenials are stereotyped as lazy and entitled. I currently dread encounters with older adults because I am always asked, “So do you have a job?” When I answer with an explanation of what I am up to, I try so hard not to make it sound like I am simply lounging at my parents’ home in front of my computer that I sound fake and disingenuous.</p><br>
					<p>Now that I am aware of stereotype threat, I think I have a better idea of how to alleviate it in social and professional situations. Moving forward, I will take care not to broach issues of race, gender, or age, and instead focus on getting people to recognize their talents. As for my own feelings of stereotype threat, I do not have a plan to deal with them. Basically, I will try to look out for number one and disregard what others may be thinking.</p><br>
