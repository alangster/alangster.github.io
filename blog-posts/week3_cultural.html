					<p>Prior to the start of Phase 0, one of the tasks I was assigned was to determine my Gregorc thinking style, so I took a short test and tallied up my responses. In doing so, I learned that my thinking style most strongly fits that of the Concrete Sequential style, followed by Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, with the latter two weighing in at roughly equal values.</p>
					<p>Concrete sequential thinkers, according to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">this site</a>, like predictability and order, and they learn best in structured environments.  Reading this did not surprise me, as I am well aware of the fact that I function best when I have a routine. Often, the most productive and fulfilling periods of my life are those during which I live like a clock, so to speak. When my time lacks structure, I find myself drifting, unable to focus or get any work done. As a result, I think DBC will be conducive to my learning, because I will be forced to wake up early every day and take the train downtown to HQ.  I anticipate having very little free time, which, frankly, is good for me. </p>
					<p>Because I also clocked in fairly strongly with both Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, I researched both of those thinking styles a bit as well. I found that Concrete Random thinkers like to experiment, solve problems independently, and compete with others. I do see these characteristics in myself, and part of me fears that they could be detrimental to my efforts at DBC. My impression is that DBC is based on togetherness, and so I will need to ensure that I buy into it wholeheartedly. As far as Abstract Sequential thinkers go, I learned that they like to use logic and work alone. While the first will be useful with the entire DBC curriculum, the second could become an issue.</p>
					<p>So far in Phase 0, the workload has not been overwhelming, so I have not had issues completing my work. However, as the curriculum intensifies, that may change (already in week three I am starting to sweat a tiny bit). Therefore, moving forward, I will need to implement strategies that give me more structure. Already I have started waking up earlier, hoping to simulate the morning routine I will have to adopt come September 15<sup>th</sup>. In addition, I spend time at my local library each day working on challenges because I find that the change in environment keeps me focused.</p>
					<p>As I progress through the DBC curriculum, I hope to become better at (and more comfortable with) working in groups. I believe part of the reason for my reservations about working with groups is I lack complete trust in others. Hopefully I will develop that trust by working with equally motivated DBC cohorts. I also hope that I become more willing to take risks in my work. I am a very practical person, and I like the things I do to work, which usually results in my relying on tried and true methods. I anticipate DBC teaching me to occasionally throw caution to the wind and take calculated risks.</p>
