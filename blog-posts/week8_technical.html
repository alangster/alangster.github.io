					<p>Despite the already thorough education I received through DBC, there remained one slight problem—I had no idea what Rails was. Well, I’m pleased to report that I now know the answer to that burning question. Let’s dive in.</p>
					<p>Rails is a web application framework that uses the Ruby programming language. The word “framework” is actually quite revealing, because what Rails does is provide the skeleton on which one can build web applications.  By providing this skeleton, Rails eliminates much of the initial work associated with creating a web application, making the development process more efficient.</p>
					<p>Rails organizes code using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. This means that web applications built using Ruby on Rails are divided into three segments—the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model is in charge of storing all of the application’s data and maintaining its logic. Essentially, it connects databases with Ruby files, receiving commands and returning the correct output. The Controller is what manipulates the Model. The Controller receives input—for example, from the user—and translates the input into commands that can be (and subsequently are) called on the Model. When the Model has gathered the necessary data, it hands the data over to the Controller, which gives it to the View. The View, then, uses HTML to display the data it received from the Controller. These three components work together seamlessly to provide a positive user experience, and their being built-in makes developers’ jobs much easier. </p>
					<p>Now that I know what Ruby on Rails is, I feel far more comfortable and am looking forward to developing my first web app!</p>
