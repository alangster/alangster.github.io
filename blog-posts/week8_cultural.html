					<p>Living with other people is never easy, conflicts arise even if you are the best of friends. I experienced this during my final year of college while living with a very good friend, one with whom I had lived for a semester the previous year. I knew him and his way of life and although it stood in stark contrast to my own, I figured we would not have any issues. Well, unfortunately, that was not the case, and as the first semester wore down, I was rather fed up with the situation.</p>
					<p>The conflict had a number of sources, starting with conflicting styles. My friend is, to put it mildly, messy, and I am, to put it mildly as well, particular. I believed that as long as his mess was confined to his area, I would be okay with it, and I was, for a while. But, the mess eventually began to creep, and its tentacles drew my attention to its disastrous epicenter, spiking my blood pressure. Our styles also differed in terms of where and how we liked to spend our time. My roommate had a light schedule, and whenever he was not in class, he was in our room. Thus, he was always in our room. While in the room, he rarely studied, preferring instead to surf the internet and, if I was there, talk to me. I am all for conversing, but this meant there was no way for me to get any work done in the room and, more importantly, I had nowhere to go to just decompress and be alone for a bit.</p>
					<p>The conflict can also be attributed to conflicting resources, and I do not only mean the room itself. My roommate’s computer charger broke halfway through the semester, and since I had the same one, I let him borrow mine anytime. What started as him taking it to his desk and hooking it up eventually became him just sitting at my desk, thus making my desk a resource over which we conflicted. Because I lent him my charger, he was in no rush to purchase a new one and so, despite the multitude of web store from which he could have purchased one—not to mention the ample free time available to visit a brick and mortar store over Thanksgiving break—he neglected to do so. As a result, I grew increasingly frustrated.</p>
					<p>I should have handled the conflict right away, just spoken to him calmly about my frustrations, but I did not. Part of me was worried about jeopardizing our friendship, and another part of me worried about appearing anal-retentive. Instead, then, I let my frustrations fester until I reached the point where I had convinced myself that I no longer wished to live with him, rather than just wanting him to clean up his act. When I told him this, calmly, he understood and agreed that if that’s what we needed to do to stay friends, then that was what we should do. I was surprised at how understanding he was, and actually a bit taken aback. Over the course of a few minutes, my frustrations evaporated. We ended up doing just that, and we remain good friends.</p>
					<p>From this experience, I learned the importance of identifying and vocalizing concerns early, as well as the importance of proposing a solution to a problem rather than simply airing grievances. I could have easily vented to him about the things he was doing that were frustrating me, but that could have led to an even greater conflict in which personal attacks are made. By focusing on finding a solution to the problem, we avoided that and worked things out.</p>
