					<p>Throughout my academic career, I prided myself on being someone who was never afraid to ask questions. This characteristic distinguished me from the majority of my classmates, as academia is suffering from a lack of student participation. I was never "that guy" in any of my classes (you know, the one who raises his hand with a question or comment on everything) because I limited my questions to concepts I did not understand. However, the answers I received often left more to be desired. At the time, I chalked that up to my professors' or TAs' inability to answer questions, but it may very well be that I was not asking the right questions.</p>
					<p>My questions can often be convoluted, especially at their outset, which may confuse or at least put off their recipient. I think my questions will be more effective if I shorten and sweeten them and get to the point sooner. In the same vein, I need to simplify my response as well. While I rarely interrupt the answerer, I need to completely eliminate that action from my options. Also, I should try to remain silent for a period after the speaker has finished answering, just in case he or she has more to offer. This practice is often recommended as a negotiating tactic as it takes advantage of the fact that most people are uncomfortable with silence. In a question and answer case, a few seconds of silence could mean the revealing of a salient bit of information. Finally, I need to make sure to ask good follow-up questions. I think this is of less importance because if I focus on achieving the earlier goals, my initial questions will be of high quality, and so they will receive answers of equal quality.</p>
					<p>Writing questions to be posted on help forums are a different beast, but I find the general question-crafting guidelines apply. One needs to be explicit in describing what the question is about and eliminate any editorializing. The folks on Stack Overflow are going out of their way to answer questions, so they should not be forced to muddle through a wall of text just to figure out what the question is asking. If the question is in regards to a chunk of code, it is essential that the relevant code be posted, as that is the only way potential answerers will be able to make recommendations. </p>
					<p>I now feel far more versed in an area in which I thought I had solid skills, and I am ready to ask penetrating questions that aid my and others' understanding.</p>
