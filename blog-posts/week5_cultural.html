					<p>Although the DBC prep phase is completed remotely, that does not mean that we budding developers do not meet. In fact, we have quite a bit of interaction, and it occurs through pairing sessions. Thanks to developers who came before us, we are able to videochat and screenshare while we work on challenges together. So far, all of my pairing sessions have gone well and I have not encountered any dismissive or combative pairs. In my opinion, one reason the sessions have gone so well is that I have yet to pair with someone whose knowledge of Ruby, Javascript, or HTML far exceeds mine. Thus, we have worked together to solve the challenges—there has not been any monopolizing of the session by a superior coder.</p>
					<p>In one of my recent sessions I experienced genuine excitement. My pair and I had a great rapport and were bouncing ideas off one another when we suddenly realized how we could drastically simplify our solution. What had been a long, somewhat draining session was suddenly given a jolt of excitement, and we happily worked through the rest of the challenge with renewed vigor. In my individual work, I have experienced such “brain blast” moments before, but sharing it with a peer made it so much sweeter.</p>
					<p>After pairing, we have to provide anonymous feedback to our pair. Often, after completing a pairing session, I am relieved that the challenge is finished and simply want to move on to the next one. Therefore, I have to stop myself from writing generic feedback, such as “Good job.” Instead, because it will be far more valuable to my pair, I must provide feedback that is specific and actionable (as well as kind, because I do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings). Specific feedback references individual things that the pair did well (or not well) to encourage (or discourage) that behavior in the future. Actionable feedback provides the pair with suggestions of alternative approaches to try in the future. </p>
					<p>Reading the feedback I receive is an interesting experience. I am used to receiving generic feedback from my classmates in school, and so I am predisposed to simply brush feedback off. But my DBC cohorts are changing me for the better. Their specific and actionable feedback has made me realize aspects of my approach to solving challenges that I should reexamine, especially as DBC phase one nears and I will be working in pairs most of the time. One suggestion I have received a couple times is to be more willing to use Google to find solutions. I tend to shy away from this because I like figuring things out on my own, but if a method exists that exists specifically to accomplish what I am trying to do, it would be silly not to at least try to find and use it. </p>
