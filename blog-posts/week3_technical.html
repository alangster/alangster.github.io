					<p>In 1995, a young programmer named Brendan Eich began working for Netscape. Eich would later go on to co-found Mozilla, one of the most popular web browsers. (Eichs would also eventually be named CEO of Mozilla, but that did not end so well…) However, it was his work at Netscape that would have the greatest influence. One month after starting at Netscape, over the course of ten days, Eich created the JavaScript language, an extremely versatile and popular language.</p>
					<p>	These days, we take it for granted that web pages are interactive—they have animations and sound, we can enter data to which they will respond, and it all occurs with lightning speed. Well, we can thank JavaScript for that. It is JavaScript that makes web browsers do things and makes web pages dynamic, thus allowing users to interact with the pages and have a better overall user experience. When you visit a page on your smartphone, there is a good chance that the site is using JavaScript to detect the type of device on which you are browsing, and then adjusting itself to give you the easiest way of navigating the site.  When you enter data like your name, address, credit card number, etc., JavaScript ensures that your input is valid, and it does so with blinding speed. The list of JavaScript’s uses is endless because it is such a versatile language, and much of that versatility is due to JavaScript’s functions. JavaScript is not unique among languages in having functions, but its functions are more adaptable than those of other languages. A language like Ruby <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2010/09/why-javascript-is-awesome/">&#34;is a toolbox with some really neat little tools that do their job really nicely,&#34; but &#34;JavaScript is a leather sheath with a really sharp knife inside. That knife can cut anything, and with it you can do anything. You can kill a bear. You can catch fish. You can whittle a piece of wood into a pony.&#34;</a></p>
					<p>	Although so far I have only provided a ringing endorsement of JavaScript, it should be said that JavaScript does have limitations. Just perusing the list of frameworks on which JavaScript may be written is exhausting, and learning and implementing those frameworks is doubly or triply so. So while JavaScript is relatively simple to learn, it is much more difficult to use it well. JavaScript cannot access databases, something on which many sites rely, and it has security issues. The same functionality that makes JavaScript useful for analytics can be put to use maliciously. Returning to the comparison of JavaScript to a knife, it must be noted that while a very sharp knife can accomplish many tasks, there are always better, more specialized tools. Other, more specialized languages can do the same things as JavaScript, It is like building a chair with a sharp knife versus building a chair with an entire workshop of woodworking tools. Sure, both chairs will be functional, but the latter will be far more comfortable and streamlined. </p>
